# file-tree-challenge

This is a take-home assignment from one of my interviews. The challenge was to build a node-rendering tree.

Initial specs:

- for implementation use data.js
- Render tree
- Add node based on selected parent name (the name should be unique)
- Edit node name (the name should be unique)
- Find node by name
- Keep current tree state in localStorage

TO DO:

- [ ] Create writeframe for the component
