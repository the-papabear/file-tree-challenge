# file-tree-challenge

This is a take-home assignment from one of my interviews. The challenge was to build a node-rendering tree.

Initial specs:

- for implementation use data.js
- [x] Render tree
- [x] Add node based on selected parent name (the name should be unique)
- [x] Edit node name (the name should be unique)
- [x] Find node by name
- [x] Keep current tree state in localStorage
